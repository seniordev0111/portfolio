Built with Nuxt.js | Vue.js | Firebase

I developed this modern accounting career reference system for university students, designed to inspire and guide them in exploring the vast opportunities within accounting.

The platform was built using Nuxt.js and Vue.js for a smooth, responsive, and engaging frontend experience, combined with Firebase for real-time database management, authentication, and scalability.

A project that blends education, technology, and creativity to unlock career possibilities for the next generation of accountants.
